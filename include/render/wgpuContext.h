// WebGPU render context: bring-up, the frame bracket, and teardown. This is
// the library's second public header, and the platform layer is its consumer.
// The game includes wgpu2d.h and never this.
//
// It names WebGPU's C types. It used to name none, so that glfwMain.cpp could
// stay free of WebGPU -- but the application now creates the surface, which
// means it already holds a WGPUSurface, so the rule bought nothing. The C
// header is enough: nothing here needs the C++ wrapper, so the application
// does not have to compile it.
//
// Why bring-up is two calls: creating a surface needs an instance, and only
// the application knows what a window is. So the library makes the instance,
// the application makes the surface from it and lends it for the frame
// bracket, then releases it after shutdown.
//
//     WGPUInstance instance = render::wgpuInitInstance();
//     WGPUSurface surface = glfwCreateWindowWGPUSurface(instance, window);
//     render::wgpuInit(surface, framebufferWidth, framebufferHeight);
//     ...
//     render::wgpuShutdown();
//     wgpuSurfaceRelease(surface);

	// queue, configures the surface at the given framebuffer size, and builds
	// the sprite pipeline and its layouts. Prints the adapter and the chosen
	// surface format to stdout. Returns false on failure.
	//
	// `surface` is borrowed. The application created it and must
	// wgpuSurfaceRelease it after wgpuShutdown. A failed init drops the
	// pointer without releasing, so the application still owns the handle.
	bool wgpuInit(WGPUSurface surface, int width, int height);

	// Reconfigures the surface when the framebuffer size changes. Cheap and
	// idempotent when it has not, so calling it every frame is fine -- and on
	// Metal that is what you want: wgpu-native never reports the surface
	// Outdated, it just keeps presenting a drawable of the configured size and
	// lets the layer stretch it. Miss this and sprites stretch while the
	// visible world does not change.

	// ---- Frame capture ---------------------------------------------------
	//
	// Copies a finished frame back to the CPU. The pixels come back as bytes;
	// writing a file is the application's job, because a drawing library has
	// no business owning an image encoder or a path -- the same reason its
	// shaders are compiled in rather than read from RESOURCES_PATH.
	//
	// The surface and every render target carry CopySrc so this is always
	// available. That is a deliberate, permanent cost: the capability has been
	// rebuilt as throwaway scaffolding five times in this project, and the
	// verification norm in AGENTS.md depends on having it.

	// Ask for the frame currently being recorded. Fulfilled inside
	// wgpuEndFrame; one request at a time, and a second before the first is
	// taken replaces it.

	// Hands over the pixels once a request has been fulfilled, and clears it.
	// False if nothing is ready.
	//
	// Tightly packed RGBA8, top row first: `width * height * 4` bytes with no
	// padding. The 256-byte row alignment the copy requires is undone here
	// rather than leaked to the caller, and the surface's BGRA order is
	// swizzled here too, so what comes out is what an image file wants.
	bool wgpuTakeFrameCapture(std::vector<unsigned char> &rgba, int &width, int &height);

	// Releases everything the two init calls created, in reverse order, except
	// the surface -- that is the application's, released after this returns.
